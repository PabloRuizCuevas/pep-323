def track_iter(obj: Iterator | Iterable, frame: FrameType) -> Iterator | Iterable:
    """
    Tracks an iterator in the local scope initiated by a for loop

    This function has a specific use case where the initialization
    of an iterator via a for loop implictely does not allow for
    reliable extraction from the garbage collector and thus manually
    assigning the iterator for tracking is used

    Note: variables are signified as '.%s' % number_of_indents
    i.e.
        for i in range(3) is 4 indents and thus is assigned '.4'

    This way makes it more effective to retrieve the iterator
    rather than appending iterators. This means only numbers
    that are divisble by 4 should not be used in general usage
    by users.

    When tracking generator expressions it uses the current
    bytecode instruction index instead
